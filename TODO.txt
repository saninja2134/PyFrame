1. Visual & UI Modernization
Implement Acrylic/Blur Backgrounds: Replace the solid rgba background with a blurred transparency effect using Qt.WidgetAttribute.WA_TranslucentBackground combined with Windows DWM API calls to match modern OS aesthetics.

Dynamic UI Scaling: Add a scaling factor to self.setGeometry(50, 50, 400, 600) that detects the user's screen resolution to prevent the overlay from appearing too small on 4K monitors.

Custom Title Bar: Remove Qt.WindowType.FramelessWindowHint's default behavior and draw a custom handle for mouseMoveEvent that includes "Minimize to Tray" functionality.


Theme Consistency: Inject a more aggressive CSS cleanup script into the QWebEngineView to force "Dark Mode" on all loaded Overframe builds.

2. Functional & Performance Upgrades

Asynchronous Image Loading: Modify SearchWorker  to fetch item thumbnails from the WarframeAPI and display them in the search_results_label using asynchronous QNetworkAccessManager calls to keep the UI fluid.

Fuzzy Search/Autocomplete: Implement a QCompleter on the search_input field using the OVERFRAME_CACHE to provide real-time suggestions as the user types.

Persistent Configuration: Create a config.json handler to save the state of the notes_input and the window's last screen position, so it doesn't reset to (50, 50) on every launch.


Enhanced World State Caching: Update update_world_data  to save the last fetched state locally, allowing the overlay to show data immediately upon opening while the new fetch runs in the background.

3. "Pro" Feature Additions

OCR Relic Scanner: Integrate an OCR library (like EasyOCR) to scan the game screen for item names during mission reward screens and automatically trigger the handle_search function.


Price Trend Graphing: Expand the get_market_item_price function to fetch 48-hour price trends from the Market API and render a small sparkline graph in the search summary.


Smart Cycle Notifications: Add a notification system in update_cycle_display that triggers a desktop toast or sound when "Cetus Night" or "Vallis Warm" begins.

Item Comparison: Add a "Compare" mode in the Search tab that allows users to split the web_view and view two Overframe builds side-by-side.

4. Code Maintenance & Distribution

Automated Cache Updates: Integrate update_cache.py directly into the OverlayController  so it checks for sitemap updates once a week on startup.


Error Boundary Implementation: Wrap the update_world_data logic in more robust try-except blocks to prevent a single API failure from freezing the ui_timer.

Virtual Environment Wrapper: Enhance run.bat to automatically check for and install missing dependencies from requirements.txt before launching main.py.
